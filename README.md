# :christmas_tree: Advent of Code 2022 :christmas_tree:
[Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/2022) by [Eric Wastl](http://was.tl)

For this years challenge I will attempt to solve as many pussles as possible using Python 3 :snake:

- [- Day 1: Calorie Counting -](./day01)  
Quite an easy start. Made a few touch-ups to the code after completing the challenge.

- [- Day 2: Rock Paper Scissors -](./day02)
Not very complicated, I didn't have to keep track of player 1 - but as usual I'm trying to think ahead in step 1 what might come in step 2, so I made the basis around keeping track of both scores. Decided to leave it in - and step 2 was just a small routine in front of step 1.

- [- Day 3: Rucksack Reorganization -](./day03)
A fun little exercise, searching for characters apperaring in multiple strings or parts of strings.
