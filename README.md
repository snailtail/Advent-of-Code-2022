# :christmas_tree: Advent of Code 2022 :christmas_tree:
[Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/2022) by [Eric Wastl](http://was.tl)

For this years challenge I will attempt to solve as many pussles as possible using Python 3 :snake:

- [- Day 1: Calorie Counting -](./day01)  
Quite an easy start. Made a few touch-ups to the code after completing the challenge.

- [- Day 2: Rock Paper Scissors -](./day02)
Not very complicated, I didn't have to keep track of player 1 - but as usual I'm trying to think ahead in step 1 what might come in step 2, so I made the basis around keeping track of both scores. Decided to leave it in - and step 2 was just a small routine in front of step 1.

- [- Day 3: Rucksack Reorganization -](./day03)
A fun little exercise, searching for characters apperaring in multiple strings or parts of strings.

- [- Day 4: Camp Cleanup -](./day04)
Today we had to check for overlap in ranges. Using sets in Python made things very easy, due to the intersect functionality.

- [- Day 5: Supply Stacks -](./day05)
This one was a bit trickier, but after I discovered that Lists in Python could be handled almost like stacks it became easier. Spent way too much time on the parsing of the input. Tried regex for picking out the moves for the crane instead of splitting as I usually do.

- [ - Day 6: Tuning Trouble -](./day06)
Parsing a string looking for the first chunk consisting of unique characters. Using the set functionality to check for uniqueness.
